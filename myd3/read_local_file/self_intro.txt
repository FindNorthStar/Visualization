电脑-控制器-运算器-存储器-输入设备-输出设备

Let's consider what accompanies a student whose major is software engineering from dawn to sunset?
The answer is computer.
Just like a computer has mouse and keyboard to receive input, I have eyes, nose, ears and mouth, so I have the ablilty to see, smell, listen and taste, which helps me better understand the environment.
In order to interact with computer, it provides a screen to display most useful information for users. Sometimes the machine can play sounds as a media player. As a human, I can also express my ideas with my voice or body gestures.
Let's take a look at the central processing unit in the computer, which can be seened as the brain in humankind. The CPU performs compuatation in a fast speed to deal with all of the tasks people told it to do. If the CPU continues to work for a long time, then the heat will accumulate gradually, which causes a bad effect on the working efficiency. So it needs some time to cool down to ensure it can work as fast as before. As a human, I often choose to have a rest when I spend a long period of time on something interesting, aiming to help my brain better prepare for the next challenge.
Don't forget the memory. It stores all the data which is necessary for reading and writing in a high speed. The software, or program, even algorithm, they all can be treated as different kinds of data storing on the storage chips. Without memory, the CPU can read nothing so it even doesn't understand where the task comes from and what the task is. Deep in my mind there are some areas for storing the memory. Every day, what I saw, what I heard and what I said can leave impression on the memory. I believe memory plays an important role in my life, and I should always cherish what I experienced and what I am doing now to make my memory full of happiness and those worth to remember.
